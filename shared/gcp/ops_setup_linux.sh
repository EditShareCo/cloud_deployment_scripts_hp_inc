# GCP Agent Policies enable automated installation and maintenance of the Google Cloud's operations suite agents across 
# a fleet of VMs that match user-specified criteria. Investigated into creating Agent Policy using Terraform on Feb 8, 2022, 
# but Agent Policy couldn't be created even though all system requirements were met, and required roles were assigned to 
# the service account. Needs further investigation, please see the doc for creating Agent Policy using automation tools at:
# https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/cloud-operations/google/latest/submodules/agent-policy

# Setup the GCP Logging agent for a VM instance.
# Array of Log file path is required as parameter(s). e.g. ./ops_setup_linux.sh "/var/log/a.log" "/var/log/b.log"
